# Student Presentation Topic Will Go Here

### Presentation Description/Overview

One of my hobbies outside of work and school is ceramics. I could use an app where I take pictures of and catalog information about my finished work. In particular I would want to add information about my glaze combinations and report on pieces that used particular glazes. I'd want a tagging system so I could filter/search on pieces using keywords. A project tracking feature would also be useful where I could log information about work from start to finish(e.g. throwing, trimming, bisque fire, glaze, final fire). A  'nice to have' would be a shrinkage calculator for quick reference. If I'm scaling this up I should probably think about logging in with multiple users and creating profiles. This can be built with Java Servlets, JSP, and a relational database
