# Student Presentation Topic Will Go Here

### Presentation Description/Overview

One of my hobbies outside of work and school is ceramics. I love experimenting with different techniques and glaze combinations, but keeping track of my work is challenging. I could use an app where I take pictures of and catalog information about my finished pieces so I can easily reference past projects, analyze what worked well, and refine my process over time.

In particular, I would want to add information about my glaze combinations and generate reports on pieces that used specific glazes. Without a system for tracking this, it’s easy to forget which combinations produced successful results or how a particular glaze reacted in the kiln. A tagging system would also be essential so I could filter and search for pieces using keywords, making it easier to identify trends or find inspiration for future work.

Beyond tracking completed pieces, a project tracking feature would be useful for logging key stages of the process—throwing, trimming, bisque firing, glazing, and final firing—so I can stay organized and monitor my progress on works in progress. A shrinkage calculator would be a great quick-reference tool to account for clay shrinkage during firing.

If I decide to scale this up, I will also consider adding multi-user support with profiles, allowing others to log in and track their own work within the system. This app, built with Java Servlets, JSP, and a relational database, would give me a structured way to document my ceramics projects, making it easier to experiment, stay organized, and continuously improve my craft.
