For those using this as a model, continue adding weekly tasks by considering:
1. which user story will you work on in a given week
2. detail the tasks needed to complete that user story
3. what we are doing in class each week and what you might add to your project as a result, either in that week or the following week
4. add in project checkpoints/milestones and tasks to achieve them
5. I started a few of these below as examples
